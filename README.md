Built with React Native <br/>
This project, Profile Page Demo, is a two-page application with a responsive layout that implements React Navigation and React Redux. <br/>
Creating a sample profile for the beloved Timothy Green, from the 2012 comedy-drama film **The Odd Life of Timothy Green**, this application allows the user to customize the profile by editing the profile's name, username, and biography. <br />
